# Word Frequency Gener-ADER
A ritzy-ditzy-glitzy word processing tool, guided and inspired by my mentor-sensei.

Things I learned: 
-Maps! Dora the Explorer time, went on an adventure
-The extremely wack syntax for regular expressions
-Clean, clean code
-Events
-Refamiliarized myself with Git/version control
-Played with the Chrome debugger
-Dynamically generate tables with createElement
-Iterators and the fact that they do things
-Trees, nodes, roots, soil, fungi
